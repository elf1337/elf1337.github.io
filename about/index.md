Hi there! My name is Akhil and I am a cybersecurity professional with a focus on web application and network pentesting. As a regular CTF player on HackTheBox, I have developed a strong set of skills and expertise in this field. My experience includes working with network and webapp pentesting, vulnerability management, and pentesting standards, as well as conducting VAPT (Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing). I am passionate about staying up-to-date and informed about the latest developments in the field, and am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a professional.
